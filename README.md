# compression-alg

Python 3 implementation of widely-used compression methodologies on Time Series

Current available algorithm: Ramer–Douglas–Peucker Algorithm, Visvalingam-Whyatt Algorithm, Optimal Algorithm, Piecewise Aggregate Approximation, Fast Fourier Transform and 1-d SAX.

Details of the algorithms can be found: [Teng X., Züfle A., Trajcevski G., Klabjan D. (2018) Location-Awareness in Time Series Compression. In: Benczúr A., Thalheim B., Horváth T. (eds) Advances in Databases and Information Systems. ADBIS 2018. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 11019. Springer, Cham](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-98398-1_6)

toy_test.py gives a toy example of how to run the compression code
